This is a website build in progress!

My name is Rowan, and I will soon be starting a PhD studying ocean convection (as part of the [VERTEXSO](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101041743) project) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Alexander Haumann](https://www.ahaumann.net) at [LMU Munich](https://www.en.geo.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) and the [Alfred Wegener Institute](https://www.awi.de). Currently, I am finishing me MSc in [Earth and Atmospheric Sciences](https://www.ualberta.ca/earth-sciences/index.html) at the University of Alberta. My background is in engineering, having graduated with a BEng from the one-of-a-kind program in [Ocean and Naval Architectural Engineering](https://www.mun.ca/engineering/ona/)  at Memorial University of Newfoundland. 

Interests
======
* General Circulation Models (GCMs)
* Submesoscale geophysical fluid dynamics, and especially... 
* Ocean convection! (Which is the focus of both my MSc and PhD)
* Polar oceanography and sea ice
* History and literature around oceanography and polar exploration, e.g., 
  * [*The Sea Around Us*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sea_Around_Us#:~:text=The%20Sea%20Around%20Us%20is,to%20the%20latest%20scientific%20probings.) by Rachel Carson
  * [*South*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_(book)) by Ernest Shackleton

In my MSc, I am studying mixing in the Labrador Sea using the [NEMO ocean model](https://www.nemo-ocean.eu) under the supervision of [Dr. Paul Myers](https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/pmyers). I am specifically studying the effects of two processes on deep convection: tidal forcing and the [Fox-Kemper parameterization for submesoscale mixed layer eddies](https://doi.org/10.1175/2007JPO3792.1) (SMLEs). The research is ongoing, but if nothing else, it's at least given me some pretty pictures! 

Some recent figures
======

Average winter mixed layer depth in the interior Labrador Sea (within the 2000 m isobath) over 2010--2020. Two atmospheric forcing products are examined, CGRF and ERA-Interim.

Maximum mixed layer depths experienced over ~20 years in a simulation with tidal forcing and the SMLE parameterization.

Snapshot of eddy kinetic energy demonstrating, if nothing else, what a 1/4 degree model resolution looks like.
