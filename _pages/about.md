At the risk of sounding overly verbose, I like to imagine the polar oceans as great climactic air conditioners---without overturning in the Southern Ocean and in the North Atlantic, and without sea ice to regulate heat uptake and to reflect incoming solar radiation, the Earth would (or maybe I should say will &#128556;) become an altogether uncomfortable place. 

My lofty ambitions are to help mitigate this future by working at the intersection of submesoscale (i.e., fairly small) fluid dynamics and climate science. Failing this, I hope to at least have some fun playing with tools like the [MITgcm](https://mitgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [NEMO](https://www.nemo-ocean.eu) ocean models. 

In my ongoing PhD research, I'm working on understanding the role of convection in setting the structure of the Southern Ocean. In particular, I'm taking a primarily model-based approach to studying how convective plumes might be an overlooked player in the upwelling of deep waters around Antarctica. My basic motivation is that Earth System Models (ESMs), like those used in the IPCC's Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects (CMIPs), have a hard time with the Southern Ocean; I believe this is in no small part because they are unable, by design, to directly represent convective plumes. I hope that, if we can figure out a way to put accurate convection into ESMs, we can ultimately instil a bit more faith into ESMs' predictions of future climactic changes. (And if the climate argument hasn't convinced you, consider that ocean convection is just plain cool, see: [Stommel, 1962](https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.48.5.766).)

If you're wondering what I mean by convective plumes, it's basically this:

My work is part of the [VERTEXSO](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101041743) project under the leadership of [Prof. Dr. Alexander Haumann](https://www.ahaumann.net) at [LMU Munich](https://www.geo.lmu.de/geographie/en/research/physical-geography-and-earth-system-interactions/research-projects-publications/vertexso/) and the [Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI)](https://www.awi.de/en/science/junior-groups/so-clim/projects.html). As a member of the AWI-LMU joint research group for Southern Ocean-Climate Interactions [(SO-CLIM)](https://www.awi.de/en/science/junior-groups/so-clim.html), I am fortunate enough to frequently travel across Germany and spend time at both institutions. The only unlucky part is the reliance on Deutsche Bahn.

In early 2024, I finished my MSc in [Earth and Atmospheric Sciences](https://www.ualberta.ca/earth-sciences/index.html) at the University of Alberta. My focus was deep convection in the Labrador Sea, which I studied using the [NEMO ocean model](https://www.nemo-ocean.eu) under the supervision of [Dr. Paul Myers](https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/pmyers). A paper on this work, or maybe even two, ought to come out at some point in the not-too-distant future (I just have to finish them first). My background before oceanography was in the tangetially-related field of [Ocean and Naval Architectural Engineering](https://www.mun.ca/engineering/ona/). (I still think boats are cool, especially sailboats, but I have no interest in designing them!)
