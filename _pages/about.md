This is a website build in progress!

My name is Rowan Brown, and I'm a second year MSc student in [Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/earth-sciences/index.html). My background is in engineering, having graduated with a BEng from the one-of-a-kind [Ocean and Naval Architectural Engineering program at Memorial University of Newfoundland](https://www.mun.ca/engineering/ona/) in 2020. 

Interests
======
* Climate change
* Geophysical fluid dynamics, especially the submesoscale
* Polar oceanography
* Everything about sea ice, from long-term trends to small-scale mechanics
* History and literature around oceanography and polar exploration, e.g., 
  * *The Sea Around Us* by Rachel Carson
  * *South* by Ernest Shackleton

It was at Memorial that I first developed an interest in polar oceanography and sea ice, where classes in physical oceanography and Arctic engineering inflamed a curiosity that eventually led me to read *The Sea Around Us* by Rachel Carson and *South* by Ernest Shackleton. From then on I was determined to pursue a career in polar oceanography---though if I ever make to Antarctica myself, I hope to avoid any Shackleton-style snafus. 

Currently, I am studying mixing in the Labrador Sea under the supervision of [Dr Paul Myers](https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/pmyers). I am specifically studying the effects of two processes on deep convection: tidal forcing and the [Fox-Kemper parameterization for submesoscale mixed layer eddies](https://doi.org/10.1175/2007JPO3792.1) (SMLEs). The research is in its early days, but if nothing else, it's at least given me some pretty pictures!

Maximum mixed layer depths experienced over ~20 years in a simulation with tidal forcing and the SMLE parameterization:
