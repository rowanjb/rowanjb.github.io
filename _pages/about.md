This is a website build in progress!

My name is Rowan Brown, and I'm a second year MSc student in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Alberta. My background is in engineering, having graduated with a BEng in Ocean and Naval Architectural Engineering from Memorial University of Newfoundland in 2020. 

Interests
======
* Climate change
* Geophysical fluid dynamics 
* Polar oceanography, especially the submesoscale
* Everything about sea ice, from long-term trends to small-scale mechanics
* History and literature around oceanography and polar exploration, e.g., 
  * *The Sea Around Us* by Rachel Carson
  * *South* by Ernest Shackleton

It was at Memorial that I first developed an interest in polar oceanography and sea ice, where classes in physical oceanography and Arctic engineering inflamed a curiosity that eventually lead me to read *The Sea Around Us* by Rachel Carson and *South* by Ernest Shackleton. From then on I was determined to pursue a career in polar oceanography---though if I ever make to Antarctica myself, I hope to avoid any Shackleton-style snafus. 

Currently, I am studying mixing in the Labrador Sea under the supervision of Dr Paul Myers. I am specifically studying the effects of two processes on deep convection: tidal forcing and the parameterization for submesoscale mixed layer eddies (SMLEs).
