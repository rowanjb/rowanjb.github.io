Hi, my name's Rowan, and I'm fascinated with the polar oceans. My current research focus is the Southern Ocean, where I'm working on understanding the role of convection in setting the structure of the surface water masses. In particular, I am taking a primarily model-based approach to studying the role of convective plumes in the entrainment of Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) into the wintertime mixed layer. The basic motivation is that Earth System Models (ESMs), like those used in the IPCC's Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects (CMIPs), have a hard time with the Southern Ocean; I believe this is in no small part because they are unable, by design, to directly represent convective plumes. Example plumes are shown in the .gif below.

If you're interested, you can check out my PhD proposal [here](https://rowanjb.github.io/files/AWI_TAC_proposal.pdf). (Or checkout the [associated slideshow](https://rowanjb.github.io/files/2024-12-03_TAC.pdf) for something a bit more palatable.)

My work is part of the [VERTEXSO](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101041743) project under the leadership of [Prof. Dr. Alexander Haumann](https://www.ahaumann.net) at [LMU Munich](https://www.geo.lmu.de/geographie/en/research/physical-geography-and-earth-system-interactions/research-projects-publications/vertexso/) and the [Alfred Wegener Institute](https://www.awi.de/en/science/junior-groups/so-clim/projects.html). As a member of the AWI-LMU joint research group for Southern Ocean-Climate Interactions [(SO-CLIM)](https://www.awi.de/en/science/junior-groups/so-clim.html), I am fortunate enough to frequently travel across Germany and spend time at both institutions. The only unlucky part is the reliance on Deutsche Bahn.

Ocean interests

* Numerical modelling, including general circulation models and large eddy simulation
* Submesoscale (and smaller) fluid dynamics, especially ocean convection
* Polar oceanography and sea ice
* History and literature around oceanography and polar exploration, e.g., 
  * [*The Sea Around Us*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sea_Around_Us#:~:text=The%20Sea%20Around%20Us%20is,to%20the%20latest%20scientific%20probings.) by Rachel Carson

In early 2024, I finished my MSc in [Earth and Atmospheric Sciences](https://www.ualberta.ca/earth-sciences/index.html) at the University of Alberta. My focus was deep convection in the Labrador Sea, which I studied using the [NEMO ocean model](https://www.nemo-ocean.eu) under the supervision of [Dr. Paul Myers](https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/pmyers). A paper on this work, or maybe even two, ought to come out at some point in the not-too-distant future (I just have to finish them first). My background before oceanography was in the tangetially-related field of [Ocean and Naval Architectural Engineering](https://www.mun.ca/engineering/ona/).
