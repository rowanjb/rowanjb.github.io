I am broadly interested in polar ocean dynamics, particularly convection, and its role in global climactic changes like a weakening of the overturning circulation and sea ice loss.

In my PhD I'm working on understanding the role of convection in setting the surface structure of the Southern Ocean, mainly using MITgcm but also some observational and reanalysis data.

If you're interested, you can check out my PhD proposal [here](https://rowanjb.github.io/files/AWI_TAC_proposal.pdf).

My project is part of the [EU-funded](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101041743) [VERTEXSO project](https://www.geo.lmu.de/geographie/en/research/physical-geography-and-earth-system-interactions/research-projects-publications/vertexso/), led by [Prof. Dr. Alexander Haumann](https://www.ahaumann.net) at [LMU Munich](https://www.geo.lmu.de/geographie/en/research/physical-geography-and-earth-system-interactions/research-projects-publications/vertexso/) and the [Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI)](https://www.awi.de/en/science/junior-groups/so-clim/projects.html).

Professional(ish) interests:
* Numerical modelling (NEMO, MITgcm)
* (Sub)mesoscale fluid dynamics, especially w/r/t convection
* Sea ice and the high latitudes
* Some favourite related books:

In early 2024, I finished my MSc in [Earth and Atmospheric Sciences](https://www.ualberta.ca/earth-sciences/index.html) under the supervision of [Dr. Paul Myers](https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/pmyers). Before getting into oceanography I studied [Ocean and Naval Architectural Engineering](https://www.mun.ca/engineering/ona/).
