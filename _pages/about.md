My name is Rowan, and I am an engineer-in-recovery with a fascination for the polar oceans. I recently started a PhD studying Southern Ocean convection using high-resolution non-hydrostatic modelling (as part of the [VERTEXSO](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101041743) project) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Alexander Haumann](https://www.ahaumann.net) at [LMU Munich](https://www.en.geo.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) and the [Alfred Wegener Institute](https://www.awi.de). I recently finished my MSc in [Earth and Atmospheric Sciences](https://www.ualberta.ca/earth-sciences/index.html) at the University of Alberta. My background is in engineering, and I have a BEng in [Ocean and Naval Architectural Engineering](https://www.mun.ca/engineering/ona/) from Memorial University of Newfoundland. 

Interests
======
* Numerical modelling, including general circulation models and large eddy simulation
* Submesoscale (and smaller) fluid dynamics, especially ocean convection
* Polar oceanography and sea ice
* History and literature around oceanography and polar exploration, e.g., 
  * [*The Sea Around Us*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sea_Around_Us#:~:text=The%20Sea%20Around%20Us%20is,to%20the%20latest%20scientific%20probings.) by Rachel Carson
  * [*South*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_(book)) by Ernest Shackleton
  * [*At the Mountains of Madness*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_the_Mountains_of_Madness) by H. P. Lovecraft

In my MSc research, my focus is/was mixing in the Labrador Sea using the [NEMO ocean model](https://www.nemo-ocean.eu) under the supervision of [Dr. Paul Myers](https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/pmyers). I am particularly interested in the effects of two processes on deep convection: tidal forcing and the [Fox-Kemper parameterization for submesoscale mixed layer eddies](https://doi.org/10.1175/2007JPO3792.1) (SMLEs).
