I am broadly interested in polar ocean dynamics, particularly convection, and its role in global climactic changes like a weakening of the overturning circulation and sea ice loss.

In my PhD I'm working on understanding the role of convection in setting the structure of the Southern Ocean. In particular, I'm taking a primarily model-based approach to studying how convective plumes might be an overlooked player in the upwelling of ice melt-inducing intermediate waters around Antarctica. My basic motivation is that Earth System Models (ESMs) have a tough time with the Southern Ocean; I believe this is in no small part because they are unable to directly represent convective plumes. 

If you're interested, you can check out my PhD proposal [here](https://rowanjb.github.io/files/AWI_TAC_proposal.pdf). 

My project is part of the [EU-funded](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101041743) [VERTEXSO project](https://www.geo.lmu.de/geographie/en/research/physical-geography-and-earth-system-interactions/research-projects-publications/vertexso/) under the leadership of [Prof. Dr. Alexander Haumann](https://www.ahaumann.net) at [LMU Munich](https://www.geo.lmu.de/geographie/en/research/physical-geography-and-earth-system-interactions/research-projects-publications/vertexso/) and the [Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI)](https://www.awi.de/en/science/junior-groups/so-clim/projects.html) in the [SO-CLIM group](https://www.awi.de/en/science/junior-groups/so-clim.html).
