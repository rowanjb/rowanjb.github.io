Tech skills
------
I always feel awkward writing what *I* think I'm good at. However, I *do* have demonstrable experience with the following:
* Python and MATLAB, including small to large datasets from model, climatological (e.g., WOA), and observational (e.g., Argo) sources 
* Modelling skills, i.e., 
  * Setting up and running models on HPCs and supercomputers
  * Numerical methods (relevant coursework at UAlberta: [Advanced Atmosphere-Ocean-Climate Modelling](https://apps.ualberta.ca/catalogue/course/eas/571))
  * Low-abstraction languages (Fortran and a bit of C) and parallelization (MPI) (relevant one-week workshop: [Parallel programming with MPI and OpenMP](https://www.bremhlr.uni-bremen.de/events/mpi-openmp-workshop/))
* Git! e.g., [my GitHub](https://github.com/rowanjb)
