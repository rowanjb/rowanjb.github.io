When applying to jobs and grad programs, I've been told it's wise to explain any gaps in employment and education. Without wanting to seem too self-absorbed, this is a complete overview of how I spent my time between getting my BEng in May 2020 and starting my MSc in July 2022. 

Part 1: Covid
======
During the last year of my BEng, my goal had always been to spend 1+ year(s) backpacking around the world (or maybe sailing) before going back to school for a master's in physical oceanography. Obviously, this wasn't an option when I graduated in May 2020, and it was by then too late to apply for grad school starting in September 2020. The job market for naval architects in Canada was going strong, and most of my classmates were already working in defence or oil & gas on the east and west coasts. However, not wanting to leave my octogenarian grandmothers and family in central Canada, I accepted that my options were limited and instead indulged my love of reading, painting, and photography. I liked to tell people at the time that I was recently retired. 

Part 2: Red Sky
======
In what I can only ascribe to Covid-induced bad judgement, I stumbled across and subsequently bought a 60-year old steel yawl at auction in mid 2020. I had lofty and admittedly naive aspirations of turning it into a liveaboard base of operations for small-boat oceanography, maybe even one day incorporating it into future grad studies. Over the next months I discovered some extensive and well-concealed rust---surprise, surprise, a budget steel sailboat turns out to be not-so-seaworthy. In the end, I scrapped the boat and sold the parts, making my money back on the lead ballast and assorted bits and pieces, not to mention the priceless list of important lessons I learned. (Chief among which is to *never* cheap out on a sailboat!)

Part 3: Minor in Mathematics
======
With the eventual goal of grad school with heavy mathematics and physics components, I took advantage of the temporarily-online course offerings from Memorial and completed the requirements for a Minor in Mathematics during Winter 2021. I had so much fun that I was tempted to the dark side (of applied mathematics)! 

Part 4: Professional work and starting my master's
======
After finishing my Minor and sending Red Sky to the scrapyard, I found myself without a job **or** a passion project. A new opportunity soon fell on my lap, and I moved back to St. John's, NL, joining Oceans Limited as an ocean engineer---essentially my dream job. (See my CV for more on the type of work I did.) However, after a bit of bad luck, including the company owner falling ill, I decided it would be best to move back home and work on applications to grad school. And three months later I was driving west to start my master's at the University of Alberta.
