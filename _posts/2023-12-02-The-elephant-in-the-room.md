When applying to jobs and grad programs, I've been told it's wise to explain any gaps in employment and education. Without wanting to seem too self-absorbed, this is a complete overview of how I spent my time between getting my BEng in May 2020 and starting my MSc in July 2022. 

Part 1: Covid
======
During the last year of my BEng, my goal was always to spend 1+ year(s) backpacking around the world (or maybe sailing) before going back to school for a master's in physical oceanography. Obviously, this wasn't an option when I graduated in May 2020, and it was by then too late to apply for grad programs with start dates in September 2020. The job market for naval architects in Canada was good, and most of my ex-classmates were already working in defence or oil & gas on the east and west coasts. However, not wanting to leave my octogenarian grandmothers and family in central Canada, I accepted that my options were limited and instead indulged my love of reading, painting, and photography. I liked to confuse people at the time by saying that I was retired.

Part 2: Red Sky
======
In what I can only ascribe to Covid-induced bad judgement, I stumbled across and subsequently bought a 60-year old steel yawl at auction in late 2020. I had lofty and admittedly naive ambitions of turning it into a liveaboard base of operations for small-boat oceanography, maybe even one day incorporating it into future grad studies. Over the next months I discovered extensive and well-concealed rust---surprise, surprise, buying a budget steel sailboat turned out to be not such a great idea. In the end, I scrapped it and just barely made my money back on the lead ballast and assorted tools, parts, and appliances. But perhaps the most valuable thing that SV Red Sky gave me was the list of lessons I learned, chief among which is to *never, ever* cheap out on a sailboat!

Part 3: Minor in Mathematics
======
With the eventual goal of grad school with heavy mathematics and physics components, I took advantage of the temporarily-online course offerings from Memorial and completed the requirements for a Minor in Mathematics during Winter 2021. I had so much fun that I was tempted to the dark side! 

(The dark side here is applied mathematics.)

Part 4: Professional work and starting my master's
======
After finishing my Minor and sending Red Sky to the scrapyard, I found myself without a job or a passion project. A new opportunity soon fell on my lap, prompting a move back to St. John's, NL, where I joined Oceans Limited for what seemed to be my dream job in ocean engineering. (See my CV for more info about the type of work I did.) However, after a bit of bad luck, including the company owner falling ill, I decided it would be best to move back home and work on applications to grad school. And three months later I was driving westward to start my master's at the University of Alberta.
